# Benchmark Window Freeze

This document is the frozen definition of the **timed benchmark window** -- the
exact work the official runner charges to the prefill and decode scores -- and
the protocol for changing it. It exists because the ranked score is paired
against a **pinned reference baseline** provisioned on the official M5 box and
calibrated at real cost. Any change to the charged work makes that baseline
(and the cached local-mode constants) mean a different thing, which forces a
new baseline for every axis that moved.

Treat a re-baseline as expensive and rare. The goal of this freeze is to make
the current calibration the last forced one: decide every window knob here, pin
it with `Tests/MLXFastTests/BenchmarkWindowFreezeTests.swift`, and pin any later
security defense that must add charged work as part of this contract.

## The soundness invariant

Every forward the timed window charges MUST be:

1. **Output-validated against an oracle.** Unvalidated charged work can be
   under-computed for free by editable model code, because nothing forces it to
   produce a correct result. (The removed decode "warmup" forward discarded its
   token, so it was reclaimable -- that is why removing it, not keeping it, was
   the correct fix.)
2. **Never an identical repeat of another charged forward in the same worker
   process.** Two identical charged forwards let editable code memoize one and
   serve the other, collapsing two charged forwards into one with no real
   speedup. Prefill, decode, and correctness each run in their own worker
   process, so no model-owned memo persists across phases.
3. **Begin at a trusted MLX free-buffer boundary.** Worker initialization is
   unscored and executes editable model code, so the first request handler for
   every new forward sequence performs a trusted 6 GiB MLX free-buffer cache reset:
   set `Memory.cacheLimit` to the trusted phase-start value, call
   `Memory.clearCache()`, and fail closed unless `Memory.cacheMemory == 0`. The
   pinned MLX API defines `clearCache()` as synchronously deallocating all
   cached (free) buffers; live model weights and KV state are active memory, so
   exact zero is safe here. The reset pins the phase-start state only -- it is
   not an enforced cap for the rest of the phase: editable code may change
   `Memory.cacheLimit` again inside the charged window, and any allocation that
   follows is charged like all other work. The substantive defense is the
   free-buffer clear, which stops unscored initialization from subsidizing the
   first charged forward. The fail-closed zero check also makes "no MLX
   allocator activity in flight across a request boundary" part of the
   submission contract: background work that repopulates the cache at a
   sequence boundary fails the run.

The current window satisfies all three: one validated seed prefill plus 128
validated single-token decode steps (decode axis), and one validated cold
prefill forward (prefill axis). The trusted parent starts each scored timer
before sending the phase-begin request, so the allocator reset is charged. Any
future window change must preserve these invariants.

## Frozen window definition

Charged work per axis. Changing any of these is a **baseline-affecting** change
(see protocol below).

Prefill axis (`measureWorkerPrefillSecondsPerToken`):

- `benchmarkPrefillPromptTokens = 512` -- prompt length of the single timed forward.
- `benchmarkPrefillWarmupRuns = 0` -- no warmup; the one timed run is cold.
- `benchmarkPrefillTimedRuns = 1` -- exactly one measured, validated forward.
- The `prefill` request applies the trusted phase-start allocator reset
  (cache-limit set plus free-buffer clear) before constructing its model cache
  or computing logits.

Decode axis (`measureWorkerDecode` / worker `decode_begin` + `decode_step`):

- `benchmarkDecodeSeedTokens = 512` -- the seed prefill, charged to the decode
  window (so future-token work cannot hide in an unscored seed phase).
- `benchmarkDecodeSteps = 128` -- validated single-token teacher-forced steps.
- Exactly one whole-prompt seed forward in `decode_begin`; the per-step forwards
  are single-token and input-dependent.
- `decode_begin` applies the trusted phase-start allocator reset (cache-limit
  set plus free-buffer clear) before constructing the decode cache or computing
  seed logits.

Measurement authority (not a constant, but part of the frozen contract):

- The trusted parent measures wall time with its own clock across the whole
  phase. Worker-reported `seconds` are diagnostic only and never feed the score.
- The parent starts the prefill/decode timer before `worker.prefill` /
  `worker.beginDecode`, respectively. The trusted allocator reset therefore
  belongs to the charged window, not unscored worker initialization.
- No allocator reset runs in `correctness_step` or `decode_step`; those handlers
  retain legitimate within-sequence KV and intermediate-buffer reuse, and their
  work remains charged to the enclosing correctness/decode request sequence.

## Serial decode integrity boundary

The current track is serial and non-speculative. Its controlling rule is that
each model invocation may compute logits and KV rows only for tokens supplied
in that invocation, and must advance logical and physical KV position by
exactly the supplied input length. A one-token decode request therefore
advances exactly one position and leaves no pending future token, logits, or
KV state for a later request.

Prompt-lookup or n-gram/history drafting, same-target lookahead, multi-row
target verification of an unsupplied draft, and cross-request future-logit/KV
buffering are outside this window. The exclusion is about what work the serial
request authorizes, not whether an implementation is generic or bit-exact.
Ordinary within-request KV reuse, input-independent caches, and multi-row
kernels whose rows all correspond to supplied prefill tokens remain valid.

The trusted worker already controls the protocol shape and advances its own
decode-step counter one request at a time. It cannot, however, inspect the
editable model's graph deeply enough to prove that the model did not compute an
extra target row and hide its logits or KV bytes behind an editable cache
abstraction. A pending-state accessor or attestation implemented in
`Sources/MLXFastModel/` would be forgeable and is not a security boundary.
Static review, source-policy regression tests, and maintainer audit therefore
remain detection controls, not structural isolation; no brittle keyword
scanner is represented as a proof of compliance.

Organizer-provided MTP or other speculative execution needs a separate track
with a trusted variable-length block request/response protocol. That protocol
must explicitly authorize draft rows, validate each proposed/accepted token
and resulting position transition, and define separate correctness and scoring
semantics before it can be ranked. Adding that track would be a benchmark
contract and baseline decision. This policy clarification does not change the
current ranked window, score formula, or paired baseline.

## Frozen ranking contract

Changing these does not require a re-baseline, but it does change how a fixed
baseline maps to a published score, so it is frozen here too and pinned by the
same test:

- `scoreDecodeWeight = 0.75`, `scorePrefillWeight = 0.25`.
- `scoreDecodeSpeedupFloor = 0.95`, `scorePrefillSpeedupFloor = 0.95`.
- `prefillBandUpTolerance = 0.05`, `prefillBandDownTolerance = 0.05`.
- `decodeBandUpTolerance = 0.02`, `decodeBandDownTolerance = 0.05`.

Acceptance bands (see `AcceptanceBand`,
`docs/thermal-variance-investigation.md`): prefill and decode are single noisy
measurements, each gated against the pinned calibration reference `R` — the
golden's `baseline_*_seconds_per_token` fields when present, else
`MLXFastConstants.officialBaseline{Prefill,Decode}SecondsPerToken`; in both
cases the cached ranked-box calibration of the pinned baseline (next
section), NOT the live same-session paired baseline. The same-session
baseline feeds only the published paired ratio, to which
`overlay-paired-timing.sh` applies the 0.95 floors — so the published paired
speedup can land slightly outside the band window when the session baseline
drifts from `R` (the drift itself is bounded by measure-job's baseline
calibration-band check). After the speedup
floors, each axis's measured value must land within
`[R * (1 - downTolerance), R * (1 + upTolerance)]`: it fails if the value
exceeds `R * (1 + upTolerance)` (a real slowdown / regression) or drops below
`R * (1 - downTolerance)` (an improvement too large to trust in one
submission, or a suspiciously lucky-fast reading).

- **Prefill: +/-5% symmetric.** Prefill is the lower-weighted optimization axis
  and a health gate, so both a regression and a lucky-fast reading past 5% fail.
- **Decode: +2% regression / -5% gain.** Decode is the axis the score rewards, so
  the up (regression) side is tight at +2%; the down (gain) side caps a *single
  submission's* decode improvement at 5%. Larger wins are still welcome -- they
  must be **chunked** across submissions so each step stays inside the band and is
  independently verifiable. The cap is per-submission, not cumulative.

`R`'s calibration and the per-axis tolerances are ranking-contract decisions,
so they are operator-owned and pinned here.

## Cached local-mode constants

The `officialBaseline*` constants in `Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift` are
a **cached calibration retained for the acceptance-band reference `R`,
local-mode estimates, and the gates pass's skip-timed placeholder timing** --
the ranked score denominator is the live paired baseline measured on the M5
box (next section), never these numbers. The values below are the Poolside
v2 calibration: the mean baseline
fields from four consecutive successful ranked M5 runs (`30011903540`,
`30015338806`, `30022640438`, and `30027994180`) against pinned baseline
commit `15852ee52858def42ddd4f32bca7e59d275e020e`. Decode ranged
`0.01382311946875`-`0.0139106712265625` (CV 0.26%); prefill ranged
`0.00036540633203125`-`0.000371515869140625` (CV 0.65%). The workflow's
`MLXFAST_POOLSIDE_V2_CALIBRATION_READY=1` interlock records that the final-SHA
baseline and versioned on-box calibration are active:

- `officialBaselineDecodeSecondsPerToken = 0.01385621216015625`
- `officialBaselinePrefillSecondsPerToken = 0.00036751938916015625`

If either number here disagrees with `Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift`, the
freeze test fails on purpose -- the doc and the code must move together.

### Paired baseline on the single M5 box

The ranked runner is a self-hosted Apple M5 Max (label `m5-bench`); active
ranked capacity is one box. The v2 paired baseline at
`/opt/bench-runner/baseline/laguna-xs-2.1-serial-v2/current` is built from
commit `15852ee52858def42ddd4f32bca7e59d275e020e` and provisioned with its
versioned calibration. The timed measurement is owned by the on-box
`measure-job` (trusted, runner-provisioned, fixed thermal contract). Per
ranked run, after all correctness/gates work, a hidden-material scrub, and a
quiescence wait, measure-job runs the pinned **baseline tree first, then the
candidate workspace**, each as a full `./benchmark.sh --official` in fresh
worker processes, each starting only once the GPU is below the fixed 40C gate
(up to a 900s cooldown), each under 100 ms macmon telemetry.
A measurement is rejected -- with one gated retry -- on GPU throttling under
load, missing telemetry, or token mismatches. Because both sides run back to
back on the same silicon behind the same gate, the paired ratio cancels
common-mode host drift. The four Poolside v2 activation runs above scored
`0.9901`-`1.0042` for baseline-equivalent candidate trees.

- The baseline sample is additionally sanity-checked against the box's
  versioned calibration
  (`/opt/bench-runner/state/laguna-xs-2.1-serial-v2/baseline-calibration.json`),
  so a broken baseline build or a sick host fails the run instead of
  repricing every speedup.
- The baseline's own floor verdict is ignored; token mismatches or harness
  errors in the baseline run fail the whole run.
- The speedup floors and the `decode^0.75 * prefill^0.25` score are applied to
  the paired ratio in the trusted shell
  (`.github/scripts/overlay-paired-timing.sh`), with the same constants the
  harness pins.
- Changing the pinned baseline tree or its calibration is a ranking-contract
  change: it redefines what "1.0x" means. Update the tree, its calibration,
  this doc, and the pinned guard tests together (operator procedure: RUNBOOK).

The harness's own paired-override plumbing
(`MLXFAST_PAIRED_BASELINE_{PREFILL,DECODE}_SECONDS_PER_TOKEN`) is still
shipped and armed: a paired override outranks golden-carried baselines, which
outrank the constants; the pair is fail-closed (both together, finite,
positive) and both variables are stripped from the sandboxed worker
environment.

### Per-prompt baselines in the golden oracle

The constants are the **fallback**, not the only source. A golden's
`benchmark` oracle may carry its own calibration:

```json
"benchmark": {
  "...": "...",
  "baseline_prefill_seconds_per_token": 0.0101,
  "baseline_decode_seconds_per_token": 0.1317
}
```

Rules, enforced at golden load and by the freeze tests:

- Both fields must be present together or absent together, finite and positive.
  A half-calibrated oracle would silently mix two calibration regimes.
- When present, scored speedups, floors, the published `baseline_*` metrics,
  and the gates pass's placeholder timing all resolve from the golden.
  When absent, everything resolves from the constants above (the pre-pool
  behavior; all public fixtures carry none).
- Carrying baselines in the golden is what makes prompt-pool rotation rankable:
  each pool prompt ships its own officially measured calibration, so rotating
  prompts of different intrinsic difficulty keeps speedups comparable. It does
  NOT change the charged window -- adding a pool prompt is baseline work for
  that prompt only, never a re-baseline of the window itself.
- On the ranked path the live paired baseline outranks both the golden-carried
  values and the constants, so pool prompts no longer need pre-calibrated
  baselines there -- the baseline is measured live against whichever prompt is
  active.

## Re-baseline protocol (how to change the window)

1. Make the window change and update the constants above in
   `Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift`.
2. Rebuild and re-measure the pinned baseline tree on the official M5 box with
   the reference model, all gates green, and refresh its recorded calibration
   (operator procedure: RUNBOOK).
3. Update `officialBaseline*SecondsPerToken` and the values quoted in this doc,
   `README.md`, and `TASK.md`.
4. Update the pinned literals in `BenchmarkWindowFreezeTests.swift` in the same
   change. The test is designed to fail until you do, so a window edit cannot
   land while silently reusing a stale baseline.

## Constant-runtime holdout: prompt pool + rotation

The ranked job runs one timed prompt to stay inside the runner time budget, so a
Kaggle-style public/private split run side by side would double the timed
runtime. The constant-runtime equivalent is a **pre-calibrated pool of
interchangeable prompts, rotated one at a time**:

- Every pool prompt MUST have identical shape: 512 prefill tokens, 512 decode
  seed tokens, 128 decode steps. Identical shape means each rotation slot
  consumes the same runtime and its per-token baseline is directly comparable to
  the others.
- Calibrate the entire pool in one baseline session (all prompts measured under
  the same toolchain, runner, and thermal state). Never add a pool member later
  without a batched calibration -- a late addition is another baseline.
- Each pool prompt's golden carries its own measured calibration via the
  per-prompt baseline fields described above, so the harness scores every
  rotation slot against that prompt's own baseline automatically.
- At ranking time, select one pool prompt per run and rotate which one is active.
  Contestants get feedback on whichever prompt they were scored against but
  cannot select-overfit a fixed trajectory across repeated submissions.

Rotating within a same-shape, pre-calibrated pool is runtime-neutral and does
not re-open the freeze: the window definition is unchanged, only the prompt
content rotates.

## Defenses that live outside this repo

These fight submission-selection bench-maxing (trying many variants and keeping
whatever scored best on one hidden prompt). They are leaderboard/orchestrator
policy, not harness code, and they do not affect the window or the baseline:

- Cap scored submissions per contestant per period.
- Keep the latest submission's score, not the best-ever (removes
  submit-until-lucky variance harvesting on the single cold prefill run and the
  single decode trajectory).
- Private holdout / rotation selection for final ranking (see pool above).
- Audit frontier-promoted submissions before they count; treat the LLM static
  review as a backup gate, never the sole guarantee for a structural invariant.

## Already implemented (context)

- Feedback coarsening: diagnostic real-valued score fields are published rounded
  to `publicDiagnosticSignificantFigures` significant figures to shrink the
  timing/memory covert channel. Ranking fields stay precise on purpose.
- The submission static review is taught to catch measurement-structure
  exploitation (input-keyed logits/KV memoization that can only hit when the
  harness repeats an identical forward).
