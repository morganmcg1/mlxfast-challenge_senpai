# mlxfast — Poolside Laguna XS 2.1 Serial Swift Challenge

Optimize serial (one token per decode request) inference for Poolside Laguna
XS 2.1 (MoE text tower, Poolside NVFP4) on Apple Silicon while preserving the model's
exact greedy output.

## Default ranked contract

`benchmark.json` and `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` define the default —
and only — Yukon track, `laguna-xs-2.1-serial-v2`.

A ranked run on the self-hosted M5 box:

1. Verifies the pre-provisioned reference checkpoint against the pinned
   manifest, builds the trusted CLI and the sandboxed participant worker,
   and transforms the reference checkpoint into `weights/`.
2. Runs the public drift tripwire, then the hidden 512-token-prompt
   teacher-forced base case plus anchor/free-run/behavior/GPQA gates and the
   semantic GPQA judge.
3. Scrubs every hidden byte from the bench workspace, then runs the timed
   paired measurement LAST behind the fixed 40C thermal gate: the pinned
   baseline tree and the candidate are measured back to back on the same
   silicon (`measure-job.sh`, telemetry-validated).

Timing measures a 512-token prompt prefill and a teacher-forced decode window
(512-token decode seed, 128 decode steps; see
`docs/benchmark-window-freeze.md` for the frozen knobs). The published score
is the paired prefill+decode weighted speedup:

```text
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
decode_speedup_floor = 0.95
prefill_speedup_floor = 0.95
```

Both floors are hard: a run below either floor, or with any token mismatch,
publishes no score.

A second, two-sided **acceptance band** also applies on the ranked path, and
it is tighter than the floors in both directions:

```text
decode_speedup  vs the pinned calibration reference: [0.980, 1.053]
prefill_speedup vs the pinned calibration reference: [0.952, 1.053]
```

The banded quantity is each timed run's measured seconds/token relative to
the pinned calibration reference (the `officialBaseline*` constants in
`Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift`), not the same-session paired
baseline that produces the published `decode_speedup`/`prefill_speedup` —
the published paired ratio is checked only against the 0.95 floors and can
land slightly outside the band window when the box's session baseline
drifts from the pinned reference.

The upper bound caps how much a single submission may gain (about 5%): a
larger measured win is either a lucky reading or too big to trust in one
shot, so **chunk it across submissions** — the cap is per submission, not
cumulative. The lower decode bound is deliberately tighter than the 0.95
decode floor. Local modes never fail on the band: `--local-iterate` /
`--local-submit` print a warning when their estimate exceeds it but still
publish the estimate; see `docs/benchmark-window-freeze.md`. A ranked run
that trips the band fails with failure category `acceptance_band_failed`.

Run `./setup.sh`, then `./benchmark.sh --local-iterate`
or `--local-submit` locally; local modes write an estimated local
`score.json` only — the official paired score comes exclusively from the
ranked M5 run.

## Model Artifacts

By default, `setup.sh` stores the frozen reference checkpoint in a shared
Hugging Face-style cache under your home directory (so parallel clones reuse
one checkpoint):

```text
~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--poolside--Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4-mlx/snapshots/841778bda563a36104dd521e37d99218e46f4f25/
```

It also creates this compatibility symlink unless the path already exists:

```text
reference_weights/laguna-xs-2.1-nvfp4-mlx/
```

By default `setup.sh` downloads
`poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4-mlx@841778bda563a36104dd521e37d99218e46f4f25`
from the public organizer R2 mirror, with the exact Hugging Face revision as
fallback. It checks cached files
against the pinned SHA256 manifest and redownloads only missing, truncated, or
hash-mismatched files. The complete manifest covers 13 files totaling
21,568,905,520 bytes, including 5 safetensors shards; `setup.sh` requires
40 GiB free by default before starting. After a
full verification, setup writes `.mlxfast-reference-cache.lock`; later setup
runs use cheap size/mtime checks from that lock and skip the full checkpoint
hash pass when the cache is unchanged. Set
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_CACHE_DIR` or `MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR` to a different local or
mounted volume when needed, or set
`MLXFAST_SKIP_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD=1` when the checkpoint is provisioned externally.

The Swift transform writes benchmark-ready weights here:

```text
weights/
  config.json
  model.safetensors.index.json
  model-0000N-of-0000M.safetensors
  tokenizer.json
  tokenizer_config.json
```

The generated `weights/` tree is a runtime artifact set, not a second physical
copy on APFS: the source is already text-only (`model.*` / `lm_head.*`), so
the transform may clone complete shards copy-on-write and writes a runtime-authored
`config.json` (the Laguna geometry fields the runtime needs,
plus the checkpoint's quantization metadata). There is no expert
streaming manifest -- the whole model, including every routed expert, is
loaded fully into RAM at
init; there is no weight streaming of any kind. Submissions may adjust this
overlay by changing both `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` and
`Sources/MLXFastModel/`; correctness and benchmark results are the authority,
not byte equality with the baseline layout.

### Accepted attention quantization envelope

The live challenge contract permits submissions to re-quantize only these
attention projections to **group-32 affine INT8**:

- query projection (`q_proj`),
- key projection (`k_proj`),
- value projection (`v_proj`),
- output projection (`o_proj`),
- per-head gate projection (`g_proj`).

This is a narrow representation allowance, not permission to change the
model's overall precision or behavior. The source checkpoint remains
authoritative, exact-token and hidden behavior gates still apply, and no other
BF16 tensor is admitted. In particular, do not infer permission to re-quantize
embeddings, Q/K norms, routers, the layer-0 dense MLP, the untied output head,
or any other unlisted projection.

The trusted harness must understand this envelope. Do not hand-edit trusted
validation to admit a new layout. On a clean research round, normal
`mlxfast sync` selects the promoted frontier; around work already in progress,
`mlxfast sync --harness-only` refreshes trusted base and harness files while
preserving editable paths.

The public correctness-only prompt and Laguna-tokenized golden are committed
under `correctness_prompts/` so participants can run a local correctness smoke
test. The official correctness golden
is supplied by the benchmark operator and is intentionally not committed to
the public repo:

```text
correctness_golden.json
```

Use `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH=/path/to/correctness_golden.json` when the
file is provisioned outside the repository root.
Benchmark CI consumes the checked-in public golden for correctness-only runs and
downloads the private precomputed correctness golden from protected storage for
full benchmark runs. The timed phase separately downloads a pinned private
evaluation prompt after the correctness scrub. The trusted box-side measurement
wrapper generates and caches a benchmark token oracle for that prompt per binary
and validates all charged outputs against it. Private prompt manifests, the
timed prompt, and hidden correctness goldens are not committed to the public
repository. Organizers regenerate correctness fixtures and rotate the timed
target through the controlled operator process.

## Editable Surface

The active editable surface is Swift-only and is defined by `benchmark.json`:

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MLXFastModel/` | Laguna XS 2.1 NVFP4 model implementation: attention (sliding-window + full, GQA, YaRN partial-rotary RoPE on full-attention layers), MoE MLP (256 routed experts + shared expert, per-head gating), RMSNorm, KV caches, weight loading, and prefill/decode execution. |
| `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` | Offline safetensors transform (text-tensor selection, config/tokenizer emission). |

`Sources/MLXFastCore/`, `Sources/MLXFastHarness/`,
`Sources/MLXFastCLI/`, scripts, tests, `benchmark.json`, generated
`weights/`, reference checkpoints, golden fixtures, and local scores are
harness/operator files, not submission surface. Correctness, scoring, timing,
golden generation, benchmark-oracle validation, and provenance checks live in
that trusted harness layer.

Account and submission management — login, clone, submit, and listing
submissions — are handled by the **Yukon CLI (`mlxfast`)**, not by
`mlxfast-swift`. The Swift binary now runs the benchmark domain only (transform,
correctness, benchmark, preflight, verify-transform); it no longer logs in or
uploads. The CLI installer defaults to `~/.local/bin`, so expose that directory
in the current shell before using it. Submit with:

```bash
export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"
mlxfast login <api-key> --api <url>
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>     # fresh checkout; an existing repo auto-links by its git remote
mlxfast submit --model "<model name>" --note "..."
mlxfast submissions
```

`mlxfast submit` reads `benchmark.json` and uploads only `editablePaths` as a
gzip tar archive with bearer-token auth; the backend applies it to the frozen
benchmark checkout and re-enforces the editable surface server-side before
running hidden validation. `--model` is required and is recorded for the
leaderboard; pass `--note-file PATH` or `--claimed-score N` as needed.
The benchmark contract also declares a local `preSubmitCommand`:
`./benchmark.sh --local-submit`. `mlxfast submit` does not run it — the upload
goes directly to official validation, and no local run blocks it. Running that
command yourself before submitting is the recommended local correctness and
timing check, without running the official hidden golden.

`mlxfast-swift verify-transform` is an organizer/debug check for deterministic
transform output. It re-runs the submitted transform and compares the generated
`weights/` tree against that fresh run. It is not a baseline-layout requirement.
The normal preflight/benchmark path also rejects generated `weights/` above the
default 25 GiB transformed-output cap before correctness or timing runs (the
text tower is about 21.6 GB, under that cap).
Override it with `MLXFAST_MAX_WEIGHTS_BYTES`; `verify-transform` additionally
accepts `--max-bytes`.

There is no Python harness path.

## Correctness Gates

Correctness is a hard gate. Each base golden case contains exactly 512 prompt
token IDs and at least 64 expected continuation token IDs. The harness checks
the first 64 continuation positions teacher-forced with temperature-zero
behavior: after each accepted step it feeds the golden previous token back into
the model. The first mismatch records only the case, step, expected token, and
actual token in the failed report.

The gate is intended as a first-stage filter: an implementation that fails it is
not eligible for the longer benchmark.

Private golden fixtures may add hidden `correctness_gates` on top of the base
teacher-forced cases:

- `anchors`: one-token checks at selected hidden contexts. These can require an
  exact expected token, explicit accepted tokens, or a bounded top-logit rank
  and delta for near-tie hardware cases.
- `free_run`: short greedy continuations whose exact prefix must match. These
  catch bugs that only appear when the model consumes its own generated tokens.
- `behavior`: GPQA-style or instruction-following prompts whose answer is
  checked exactly against precomputed accepted answer token sequences. Each
  accepted answer sequence must have at most `max_new_tokens` tokens; shorter
  sequences are matched as exact prefixes of the generated answer.

Full benchmark CI adds one more private layer after the correctness and gates
pass (and before the timed measurement, which runs last on the ranked
pipeline): it captures short answers for hidden GPQA cases and asks a Claude
judge whether each candidate is semantically equivalent to the private
reference answer. That semantic gate is pass/fail only and does not affect
the timing score; its pass-count threshold is baseline-calibrated (see
`MLXFastConstants.semanticGPQAMinPassCount`). The uploaded score records only
aggregate semantic counts and the judge model name.

The same hidden GPQA cases are also used for a TTFT guardrail: during the
hidden behavior correctness pass, the workflow times prompt prefill through
the first greedy answer token and verifies that the first token is accepted for
that case. The uploaded score records only
aggregate TTFT pass counts and timing statistics; first-token values and
accepted token sets are not logged or artifacted.

These layers keep the official gate mostly deterministic and token-based while
adding a small semantic backstop against implementations that pass the exact
prefix but damage answer meaning. The benchmark operator should keep private
prompts, accepted answer sequences, reference answers, and judge transcripts
outside the public repository.

The gate intentionally does not port a hidden-state comparison layer. The
benchmark contract cares about the externally observable text-to-text Laguna
output path, and hidden-state tensors are easier to make ambiguous around
normalization than token-level or logit-anchor checks.

VLM/image and audio inputs remain out of scope. Only the Laguna text tower
executes.

### Serial non-speculative rule (default track)

In `benchmark.json`, each model
invocation may compute logits and KV rows only for tokens supplied in that
invocation, and must advance logical and physical KV position by exactly the
supplied input length. A one-token decode request therefore advances exactly
one position and leaves no pending future token, logits, or KV state for a
later request.

This excludes prompt-lookup decoding; n-gram, suffix, or other token-history
drafting; same-target lookahead; and any other mechanism that selects or
evaluates an unsupplied future token. It also excludes two-, three-, or
more-row target-model execution used to verify a draft from a one-token
request, plus cross-request future-logit/KV buffering, deferred cache rows,
and commit, rollback, recommit, or discard markers for such rows. These
mechanisms remain excluded when they are generic, bit-exact, or useful in
production. Warming an excluded speculative pipeline before the worker
protocol hello or during model initialization does not make it eligible.

Ordinary within-request KV reuse remains allowed, as do current-token-only
decode execution and input-independent caches for weights, dequantized
tensors, kernels, masks, or RoPE tables. Multi-row kernels are allowed when
every row corresponds to a token actually supplied in that same invocation,
such as ordinary prefill; the prohibited case is using extra rows to compute
or verify future tokens for a serial one-token request.

Organizer-provided MTP or other speculative decoding would require a
separately declared trusted block protocol, correctness contract, and score;
no such track currently exists, so these
restrictions apply to every ranked submission.

## Score

```text
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
```

Higher is better. Each speedup is the pinned baseline's seconds/token divided
by the candidate's, with both sides measured on the same M5 in the same
session behind the same fixed thermal/telemetry acceptance (the paired
baseline cancels host drift). The hard component floors are:

```text
decode_speedup >= 0.95
prefill_speedup >= 0.95
```

A run below either floor or with any token mismatch is ineligible. The score
is null when any gate fails. The two-sided acceptance band described above
(speedup vs the pinned calibration reference in `[0.980, 1.053]` for
decode, `[0.952, 1.053]` for prefill) applies on top of the floors and is
evaluated against that pinned reference, not the paired session baseline;
local modes warn when their estimate exceeds it but never fail on it.
`score.json` also carries prefill and decode
seconds/token, speedups, floor verdicts, gate results, and
transformed-weight identity.

## Useful Commands

```bash
swift test --force-resolved-versions
MLXFAST_RUN_MLX_RUNTIME_TESTS=1 swift test --force-resolved-versions
swift build -c release --force-resolved-versions
./setup.sh
./benchmark.sh --local-iterate
./benchmark.sh --local-submit

# Submitting is done with the Yukon CLI (mlxfast), not mlxfast-swift:
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>
mlxfast submit --model "<model name>" --note "..."
mlxfast submissions
```

Always pass `--force-resolved-versions` to direct `swift build` / `swift
test` runs: the dependency graph is frozen, and a bare invocation can
silently rewrite `Package.resolved`, after which `./setup.sh` and
`./benchmark.sh` refuse to run until you restore it with
`git checkout -- Package.resolved`.
