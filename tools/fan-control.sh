# Manual Mac fan control helper for the local benchmark thermal gate.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/fan-control.sh boost    # force every fan to 70% of its maximum speed
#   tools/fan-control.sh normal   # hand fan control back to macOS (automatic)
#   tools/fan-control.sh status   # print one of: manual | auto | none
#                                 # (manual = at least one fan's mode bit set)
#
# `boost` refuses to run while any fan is already in manual mode: that bit
# means another fan controller (or a prior boost that was never restored)
# holds the fans, and boosting would silently overwrite its targets. It also
# reads every write back from the SMC and refuses to report success for a fan
# whose write did not stick (some firmware silently drops fan writes unless a
# global force-gate like Ftst is set; this helper deliberately never writes
# that key).
#
# WHY THIS NEEDS SUDO: fan targets live in the System Management Controller
# (SMC), and macOS only accepts SMC key writes from root. `boost` and `normal`
# therefore run their `smc` writes under sudo. sudo prompts for your password
# itself, on your terminal, via its normal secure prompt: this script never
# reads, stores, echoes, or logs the password (no piping a password into
# sudo's stdin, no askpass plumbing), and it invalidates sudo's cached
# credential right after the writes with `sudo -k`, so no elevated session
# lingers.
#
# The boost target is HARD-CODED at 70% of each fan's maximum RPM. Do not
# raise it: 70% already moves most of the air the fan can move, and the last
# 30% mostly adds noise and wear. `normal` pins nothing -- it clears the
# manual-mode bit so macOS's automatic fan curve takes over again, exactly as
# if this script had never run.
set -euo pipefail

readonly FAN_BOOST_PERCENT=70  # hard cap by design; see the header comment
# Read-back tolerance when verifying a written fan target. The SMC stores
# the target as a 4-byte float, so the value read back can differ from the
# one written by rounding -- fractions of an RPM, never more. Anything
# further off than this means the firmware did not accept the write.
