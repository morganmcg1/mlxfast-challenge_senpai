// Certified two-pass lm_head elision for the final-token projection (notes/68).
//
// Stock lm_head reads the full BF16 [100352, 2048] weight (411 MB) for the
// final hidden row at the DRAM wall. This module, gated by
// DARKBLOOM_LM_HEAD_PRUNE (DEFAULT ON; set "0" to disable; unset = shipped
// path), replaces it for
// both prefill's already-sliced last hidden row and single-token decode with:
//
//   1. COARSE pass (`lagunaLmHeadInlineCoarseKernel`): one fused GEMV over an
//      init-time MXFP8 copy of lm_head (gs32 e8m0+e4m3, 211.9 MB) built with
//      the repo's own `quantized(..., mode: .mxfp8)`, producing per-row coarse
//      logit c_i and a certified bound delta_i. delta_i =
//      d_i*(1+gamma) + 2*gamma*m_i with
//      d_i = sum_g sd_g * sum_{j in g} |x_j| * hs8(code_ij)
//          >= sum_j |x_j| * |w_ij - what_ij|   (half-ulp cells, top cell 186)
//      and m_i = sum_j |x_j| * |what_ij|, so delta_i covers BOTH the
//      quantization error and both kernels' float rounding (depth <= 96
//      roundings/element-path << gamma = 2^-15 relative; notes/68 section 6).
//      DEFAULT (DARKBLOOM_LMHEAD_RATIO_BOUND, default ON) the kernel emits the
//      strictly-not-smaller closed form d_i*(1+61*gamma), which is legal
//      because |decode_e4m3(code)| <= 30*hs8(code) for all 256 codes gives
//      m_i <= 30*d_i termwise; that drops the m_i accumulator and its
//      SIMD reduction. Set the variable to "0" for the accepted two-term form.
//      Ratio certificate, all 256 codes, using this file's own decoders
//      (mag = b & 127, e = mag >> 3, m = mag & 7):
//        e == 0 (denormal, mag 0..7): decode = m*2^-9, hs8 = 2^-10,
//          ratio = 2m <= 14 (attained mag 7).
//        e >= 1, mag != 126: decode = (8+m)*2^(e-10), hs8 = 2^(e-11),
//          ratio = 16 + 2m <= 30 (attained m = 7, e.g. mag 15 and mag 127,
//          the latter decoding to 480 with hs8 = 16).
//        mag == 126 (saturated top, decode 448, open cell hs8 186):
//          ratio = 448/186 = 2.409.
//      So max ratio = 30, exactly attained. The inequality is per element
//      over the SAME elements with the SAME non-negative group scales sd_g
//      (e8m0 decodes to a positive power of two for every byte), and |x_j|
//      >= 0, so it lifts termwise to the row sums: m_i <= 30*d_i, hence
//      d_i*(1+gamma) + 2*gamma*m_i <= d_i*(1 + gamma + 60*gamma)
//      = d_i*(1 + 61*gamma). Both scalar constants are exact in FP32
//      (1+2^-15 and 1+61*2^-15 need 15 mantissa bits) and 2*gamma = 2^-14
//      is a power of two, so the substitution is exact at the constant
//      level: (1+gamma) + 30*(2*gamma) == (1+61*gamma) bit-for-bit.
//      FP32 evaluation note: the one-term form can land at most ~3 ulps
//      (~1.8e-7 relative) below the two-term form when m_acc sits exactly
//      at 30*d_acc. That is absorbed many times over by the certificate's
//      own rounding headroom -- gamma = 2^-15 = 3.05e-5 against the
//      <= 96*2^-24 = 5.7e-6 of accumulated FP32 rounding it must cover,
//      a >5x margin -- so the emitted delta still bounds the true error.
//      DEFAULT (DARKBLOOM_LMHEAD_DELTA_BF16, default ON, nested inside the
//      ratio bound) delta_i is stored as BF16 rounded toward +infinity
//      instead of FP32, halving that buffer's write and both of its reads
//      (401,408 -> 200,704 bytes per token per traversal, ~0.6 MB/token in
//      all). delta is only ever COMPARED downstream and candidacy is
//      MONOTONE in it -- a larger delta lowers L = max(coarse - delta) and
//      hence the threshold, and raises each row's `coarse + delta` -- so
//      rounding it up only widens the certified bound and only grows the
//      candidate set. `coarse` stays FP32: it would have to round DOWN for
//      the L path and UP for the candidate test, which one buffer cannot do.
//      Set the variable to "0" for the FP32 delta round trip.
//      BOTH selectors are ARM-ORTHOGONAL: they apply identically on the
//      DARKBLOOM_LMHEAD_COARSE_V4 int6 arm (the shipped default), where the
//      flat half-cell makes the ratio 2*|q| instead of a format table. The
//      int6 codes decode to q = u - 32 and `buildInt6Planes` VERIFIES
//      max|q| <= 31 on the actual tensor (declining to the MXFP8 copy if it
//      ever fails), so per element the m term sd*|x_j|*|q_ij| is at most 62x
//      the d term (0.5*sd)*|x_j| -- same elements, same positive power-of-two
//      sd_g -- giving m_i <= 62*d_i and the closed form d_i*(1 + 125*gamma).
//      That substitution is likewise exact in FP32: (1+gamma) + 62*(2*gamma)
//      == 1 + 125*gamma bit-for-bit. See the int6 ratio-bound kernel below.
//      The e4m3/e8m0 decoders below are bit-exact replicas of the vendored
//      fp8.h / fp_quantized.h semantics (no libm: exponent-bit construction).
//   2. EXACT pass (`lagunaLmHeadInlineExactKernel`): each simdgroup owns a FIXED
//      block of four output rows and runs a full BF16 GEMV over that block
//      only when `coarse[r] + delta[r] >= threshold` for one of its rows,
//      writing `bfloat(coarse[r])` otherwise. The predicate and BF16 cast are
//      textually the same operations as the retained mask/coarse_bf path, so
//      NaNs, signed zero, and every stored FP32 coarse bit keep their existing
//      behavior while the selector dispatch and both temporary buffers vanish.
//      The per-row arithmetic is a TEXTUAL replica of the stock
//      `gemv_al_bfloat16` (bm8_bn1_sm1_sn32_tm4_tn4_nc0_axpby0; see gemv.h
//      GEMVKernel::run with kAligned=true) -- same lane partition, same
//      sequential f32 order, same vec4 loads, same simd tree, same BF16 cast
//      -- and, because the row-to-thread mapping is the stock one rather than
//      an indirection, each candidate row's output is bit-identical to the
//      stock full GEMV's (R1). Every vocabulary slot is written by exactly one
//      lane on exactly one path, so the row is fully covered with no race and
//      no uninitialized slot. Non-candidate slots keep the BF16 coarse value,
//      which the certificate shows is strictly below the winner; the harness
//      argmaxes the returned row (LagunaCorrectness.swift:108), so the emitted
//      token is the stock token.
// The threshold beta widens the candidate set slightly vs the raw lower bound
// L; it is the BF16-cast safety margin from the assembly proof.
//
// `DARKBLOOM_LMHEAD_INLINE_MASK=0` restores the new tip's three-output coarse
// kernels, fused two-pass lower-bound reduction, dense uint8 selector mask,
// and coarse_bf-fed exact kernel inside the same binary.
