// Correctness-first Laguna runtime (Poolside Laguna XS 2.1, 256-expert MoE).
//
// This module tree closely follows the vendored reference implementation at
// `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Laguna.swift` (`LagunaModel` /
// `LagunaModelInner`), which is the behavior oracle for this port. It is a
// reimplementation rather than a wrapper for two load-bearing reasons:
//
// 1. The Poolside checkpoint stores the MoE router as a raw BF16
//    `mlp.gate.weight` matrix next to the F32
//    `mlp.gate.e_score_correction_bias`, while only expert projections are
//    NVFP4. The runtime mirrors those parameter paths exactly.
// 2. The vendored `LagunaModelInner`/`LagunaDecoderLayer` types are
//    fileprivate and `LagunaConfiguration`'s stored properties are internal
//    to MLXLLM, so the runtime layers (cache geometry, future fast-engine
//    and exact-verification waves) could not reach the internals through a
//    plain wrapper.
//
// All math is expressed with standard MLX ops and the vendored shared
// primitives (`attentionWithCacheUpdate`, `initializeRope`,
// `applyRotaryPosition`, `SwitchGLU`, `weightedExpertSum`, `RMSNorm`,
// `createAttentionMask`). No custom Metal kernels in this increment; the
// fused fast-engine and exact-pair/exact-four style optimizations are a
// later layer on top of this reference target.

/// Decode-only fusion of the three attention input projections into one

/// independent, so MLX already issues them into one barrier group; what this
/// removes is two dispatches per layer, and it does so without the
/// row-concatenated `[Wq; Wk; Wv]` bank behind `DARKBLOOM_FUSED_QKV` — the
/// kernel reads the three stock weights in place, so prefill's GEMM shapes,
/// scheduling and resident memory are all untouched.
///
/// Exactness: MLX's gemv gives every output row its own K loop and its own
/// simdgroup reduction, and the tiling it picks for all three shapes shares
/// SM 1, SN 32, TM 4, TN 4, BN 1 (only BM differs, which just regroups rows
/// across threadgroups). So a row's arithmetic does not depend on which
/// dispatch or which simdgroup computes it: lane `l` covers columns
/// `4l + 128i`, products accumulate in `i` then `tn` order in FP32, and the
/// simdgroup reduces with the same `simd_shuffle_down` ladder before lane 0
/// rounds once to BF16. Row blocks are sized so no simdgroup ever straddles
/// two of the three matrices.
/// The kernel also absorbs the layer's input RMSNorm, which every one of these
/// projections consumes. Each threadgroup recomputes the 2048-element norm
/// from the raw residual row — 4 KB read and one 2048-element reduction
/// against 32 MB of weight traffic — and keeps the normalized row in
/// threadgroup memory for its own K loop, so the norm leaves the dependency
/// chain entirely. The per-head gate projection is folded into this same
/// kernel and also reads the threadgroup row, so no device-visible normalized
/// output is needed.
///
/// The norm reproduces `rms_single_row` at `axis_size == 2048`, `N_READS == 4`
/// and a 512-thread group, which is exactly the shape MLX dispatches for this
/// row: thread `lid` squares its own contiguous four elements in index order,
/// `simd_sum` inside each of the sixteen simdgroups, lane 0 of each writes into
/// `local_sums`, simdgroup 0 `simd_sum`s those, and
/// `precise::rsqrt(acc / 2048 + eps)` is broadcast. The BF16 rounding stays
/// inside `w[i] * bfloat(x[i] * inv)`, which is the value the separate kernel
/// would have written and these projections would have read back.

/// per-call multiplies and folds it into the one multiply
/// `laguna_nvfp4_scale` already performs. **−16 scalar multiplies per
/// `qdot_16` call, −16.5% of the dequantize ALU, ~−1104 M float multiplies per

///
/// Bit-exact. `16384 == 2^14`, and scaling a binary float by an exact power of

/// value — same bits, different exponent — and the `2^14` reappears once in
/// the scale before the single final rounding.
///
/// **The dtype move is range-checked, not assumed** (`notes/58` §1a). The
/// multiply moves from half to float because `4194304` overflows half, and a
/// power-of-two argument does NOT by itself survive a dtype change — so all
/// 256 E4M3 scale bytes were enumerated through both paths, in half and in
/// float, with an explicit `isfinite` check on the old path. **Zero
/// divergence, and no overflow is reachable:** the shuffle
/// `(bits & 127) << 7` maps E4M3 into half format, and since E4M3's exponent
/// bias is 7 against half's 15 it already yields the scale divided by 256 —
/// which is exactly what the old `*= 256.0` corrected. The half-domain
/// intermediate therefore peaks at **1.875**, and the scale at **480**,
/// against half's finite max of 65504. **136x headroom.**
///
/// The compiler cannot do this fold itself: `device.cpp:631` sets
/// `setFastMathEnabled(false)`, so reassociating `Σ(a·h·2^14)` into
/// `2^14·Σ(a·h)` is forbidden and all sixteen multiplies really are emitted.

// MARK: - Layer-0 dense MLP fusion (BF16, no quantization)
//
// Layer 0's `gate_proj`/`up_proj`/`down_proj` are plain BF16 `Linear`, never
// NVFP4 `QuantizedLinear` -- every fused-bank guard above this point casts to
// `QuantizedLinear` and always declines for layer 0, so it fell all the way
// through to four fully separate stock dispatches (gate GEMV, up GEMV,
// `compiledSiluProduct`, down GEMV) plus the decoder layer's own separate
// `h + r2` residual add. The two kernels below close that gap.
//
// `laguna_dense_gate_up_swiglu_bf16_v1` fuses the gate and up projections
// plus the SiLU-gated product into one dispatch (3 dispatches -> 1).
// Exactness: the row loop is the plain-BF16 "projections" tiling already
// shipped and documented on `lagunaFusedQKVProjectionSource` above (SM 1,
// SN 32, TM 4, TN 4, BN 1 -- see that kernel's doc comment) for this exact
// out_vec/in_vec pair: 8192 output rows over a 2048-wide input is precisely
// the sliding-attention Q projection's shape (`slidingAttentionHeads(64) *
// headDim(128) == 8192`, dispatched at lines 932-983 above), so that same row
// loop -- `block_width 128`, `blocks = in_vec_size / 128`, `rows_per_group
// 64`, `rows_per_thread 4`, one `vec<bfloat, 4>` read per block, FP32
// accumulation, the `simd_shuffle_down` ladder (16, 8, 4, 2, 1), one BF16
// round -- is bit-exact here too. The loop is duplicated per output row (one
// pass over `gate_weight` and one over the row-shifted `up_weight` half of
// the same fused bank) so a single shared read of the input row produces both
// the gate row and its matching up row, generalizing the two-lane-per-simdgroup
// pairing already shipped in `lagunaSharedSwiGLUQMVKernel` above (lines
// 1664-1688, `outputs_per_simd == 2`) to this file's standard
// `rows_per_thread == 4`. The SiLU epilogue -- round each accumulator to
// BF16 first (matching stock `gateProj`/`upProj`'s own output rounding), then
// the numerically-stable sigmoid and the BF16 product -- is copied verbatim
// from that same kernel's tail (lines 1691-1704), which is dtype-generic (not
// NVFP4-specific) and already reproduces `compiledSiluProduct`'s exact BF16
// rounding boundary.
//
// `laguna_dense_down_residual_bf16_v1` fuses the down projection with the
// decoder layer's residual add (2 dispatches -> 1). Exactness: the row loop
// is the plain-BF16 row loop already shipped on
// `lagunaGatedOutputProjectionSource` above for the identical out_vec/in_vec
// pair -- 2048 output rows over an 8192-wide input is exactly the
// sliding-attention output projection's shape (in_vec = heads(64) *
// headDim(128) == 8192, dispatched at lines 1064-1117 above) -- minus that
// kernel's per-head gate multiply (layer 0's down projection has no gate to
// fold in), so `block_width 128`, `blocks = in_vec_size / 128`, `rows_per_group
// 16`, `rows_per_thread 4` reproduce the identical MLX gemv tiling for this
// shape. The epilogue mirrors `lagunaSharedDownResidualKernel`'s tail
// rounding order above (lines 1789-1797): round the GEMV accumulator to BF16
// first, matching stock `downProj`'s own output rounding, then add the
// residual and round once more -- reproducing stock `h + r2` bit-for-bit.
